# WideFlow Excercise

Develop a small application with a focus on code readability, bearing in mind that your teammates will continue its development thereafter. You have the option to either use angular-ui as a foundation for your app or build it from scratch.

## Instructions

Utilize the 'books.json' file to simulate backend data for your application. You can locate the 'books.json' file at the root of this project or within 'angular-ui/src/app/services/books.json', where it is already being utilized.

If you opt to use Angular-UI as the foundation for your development, simply navigate to the 'angular-ui' directory and run 'npm install' followed by 'npm run'.
